## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MuhammadHuzaifa-Dev/calculator-with-Tailwindcss-and-Javascript.git
cd calculator-with-Tailwindcss-and-Javascript
```

### 2. Install Tailwind CSS (if modifying styles)

Tailwind is already built into `output.css`, but if you want to rebuild:

```bash
npm install -D tailwindcss
npx tailwindcss init
```

Update your Tailwind config and rebuild with:

```bash
npx tailwindcss -i ./input.css -o ./output.css --watch
```

### 3. Open the Project

Just open the `index.html` file in your browser or deploy using Vercel/Netlify.
